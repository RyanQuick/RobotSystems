It looks like you used typical naming schemes for classes, functions, and variables which makes things easier to read. Your spacing also looks correct for the most part as well. Very easy to read. You've also compartmentalized things well which is good. I personally don't like using a bunch of separate .py files, but I think your method is "best practice". Overall looks polished, well done.Â I don't have any critical feedback to improve your work however as I am less versed in best coding practices.
