It looks like you used descriptive function names and variables with _ for spaces. You've even included function descriptions with what parameters it takes, which is awesome. 

For Arm perception (finding cubes in the cameras vision)
You've done a nice job of breaking the code out into a series of functions that compartmentalize the work into sections. These functions also take fewer inputs, which is also good. Mine had more inputs for one or two than I would have liked.

You've also removed all old code and comments from the previous work that wasn't useful, which is great.

All global variables were removed, so nice job there. 

One thing you could have done is add some way of debugging your work, such as a def test() function or logging methods. I think this code (perceiving cubes) would also fit well within a class.  Overall nice job on your code this week!
	


What I learned
I spent the most of this week trying to figure out how I wanted to compartamentalize the motion code into functions. Through this, I learned how the API for this robot interfaces with the provided code. It seems the robot arm is sent a position for the gripper, and if it passes a check, it drives the gripper to that position.

Project Pitch


One Idea I had was for some more complex cube manipulation. I was thinking of making the robot arm look for all three cubes and then stack them vertically. If it fails, then it would try to stack them again. Once the three were stacked atop each other, then the robot would try to pick up all three from the bottom at once. After moving the stack, it could tip them over and start again.
